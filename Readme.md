## Outline

The provided code is a laravel controller that seems to be responsible for handling various operations related to bookings. I will try my best to provide facts that make this code Amazing, OK, or Terrible.

## What makes this an Amazing code?

Let's talk about the good/best practices that have been used in the provided code.
* I see that there's the use of dependency injection in the constructor for the BookingRepository which is a good practice. It allows the developer to re-use and test code properly.
* The coding design pattern seems to be a Repository Pattern. This helps in separating the logic that retrieves the data from the database from the business logic of the application. This also enhances maintainability, easier testing, cleaner & modular code.
* The method names are clear and descriptive and pretty much reflect the functionality they provide, thus enhancing readability.
* The code in the ```index``` method is considering different roles like Admin & SuperAdmin. So following this point, it shows awareness with levels of authorization within the application.
* The methods follow standard RESTful Resource Controller actions i.e. index, show, store, update. This reflects a clear structure that is accepted as a best practice.

These practices contribute to a codebase that is more maintainable, understandable, and aligned with the accepted standards and principles. However, the positive impact of these practices could be further leveraged with improvements in the areas previously mentioned.

## What makes this an OK/Bad code?
Not lets talk about the areas of improvements in the provided code.

* There's code duplication in multiple methods, like for example where you are checking for user authentication, that could be abstracted to private methods or even better, middlewares.
* There's lack of input validation, which ultimately exposes the application to potential malicious input and compromising data integrity.
* There's inconsistent return types i.e. some methods return response object, while others might return null or a string. Consistent return types make the code easier to understand.
* We can improve the code by utilizing Laravel's Form Request Validation.
* Hard coded values like 'yes' or 'no' should be avoided. Laravel recommends the use of configuration files or constants.
* The code directly fetches .env variables using ```env()``` function which is not considered a good practice. This isn't considered a best practice as changes to .env file at runtime may not be reflected in the configuration values. Using these variables through laravel's configuration files might improve maintainability.


## Conclusion

The code seems to be an **OK** code and there's room for improvement. It also utilizes good practices like dependency injection and clear method naming, lack of input validation, code duplication, inconsistent return types and other issues overshadow the positive aspects. I will try my best to properly refactor the code to best practices.
I have not completely refactored the code inside ```BookingRepository.php``` but tried to show the possible solutions to improvements. The rest of the methods can be improved in similar way.
